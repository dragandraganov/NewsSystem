    Final clinical trials of a malaria vaccine - the first to reach this stage - suggest it could help protect millions of children against malaria.
    But tests on 16,000 children from seven African countries found that booster doses were of limited use and vaccines in young babies were not effective.
    After children aged 5-17 months were given three doses of the vaccine, the immunisation was only 46% effective.
    But experts say getting the vaccine this far is a scientific milestone.
    Data from the trial published in The Lancet showed that the success rate fell to even lower levels in younger infants.
